# Hello, Iâ€™m Valgeir ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and product designer @ [Syndis](https://syndis.is/)

Iâ€™m continuously building and refining [Aftra](https://aftra.io/), a brand new SaaS platform, where I lead both the frontend development and design.

I'm always working on something fun, check out my [portfolio](https://valgeir.dev/) for more about me.
